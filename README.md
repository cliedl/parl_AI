# parl_AI: DSR Final Project for European Elections

##Description
This is our final project for the Data Science Retreat, a boocamp in Berlin. We are on a mission to enhance the democratic process within the European Union by developing an innovative chatbot application. This application will be powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which will be meticulously fed with comprehensive data from EU election programs and the speeches of politicians throughout the preceding legislative period. The core of our system is a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze and synthesize the nuances of EU policies and political party stances. By integrating the LLM with our RAG system, we enable the chatbot to process voter inquiries.

Voters will have the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with our chatbot, posing questions and expressing concerns about various EU policy domains. In response, our chatbot will provide informed, data-driven insights into the collective positions of the EU political landscape. This conversational interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing for a seamless flow of information that empowers voters to make well-informed decisions at the polls.

##Objective
Our project aims to aid individuals in making an educated choice when voting in the European Election on June 9, 2024.

##Target Audience
- EU eligible voters in Germany seeking AI-assisted decision-making for the European Election.
- Political enthusiasts with a nascent interest in EU politics.

##Data Foundation
- EU election programs of German parties
- Speeches from the previous legislative period in the EU Parliament (2019-2024).
